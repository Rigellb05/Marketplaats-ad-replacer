This bot is made to replace Marketplaats ads and delete them after.
It is made to run when your not using your computer (It uses the movement of the cursor).
You have to login to your account, open the page that is available to everyone that shows all your ads.
Then run it and see it do its thing.
Please use this wisely.
You do need to download some "API's" to make the code work (pyautogui, requests, BeautifulSoup (maybe PIL and pytesseract if needed later when the code is done))

WARNING:
- For now, this only works on 16 : 9, 1080p panels (This should be changed in the future)
- If you have a panel with a different resolution, it can be changed in the settings to run the code fine
- This is not perfect, it will probably still make some errors
- Please put the scaling to 125% is the settings

Please send me a email to rigel36000@gmail.com for any bugs and suggestions.
